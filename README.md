A semi-customizable bar written using the [Fabric Widget System](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric) taking inpirations from hyprpanel and waybar for some widgets
More on [Fabric's Wiki](https://wiki.ffpy.org)

The panel focuses on providing an all-in-one, fully integrated panel experience, where users don’t have to rely on separate, theme-less third-party tools to manage niche functions like buetooth, notifications,on screen display.
Many aspects of the bar including the look and functionalities are inspired from [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), [hyprpanel](https://hyprpanel.com) and [swayosd](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayOSD).

- Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rubiin/HyDePanel.git bar
cd bar
```

- Run the following command to install the required packages for particular os, few of them are already installed if you have a working system:

## Installation

You can choose one of two installation methods: **Automated Setup** or **Manual Setup**.

### Option 1: Automated Setup Using `init.sh -install`

1.  **Run the `init.sh -install` script** to automatically install all the required packages and dependencies (both `pacman` and AUR packages):

```sh
./init.sh -install
```

This script will:

- Install all required `pacman` and AUR packages.
- Set up the virtual environment and any required configurations.

1.  **Start the environment or bar** once the installation is complete:

```sh
./init.sh -start
```

This will launch the environment or bar as defined in your project.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Install Dependencies First)

If you prefer to have more control over the installation process, you can install the required dependencies manually and then run the `init.sh -start` script.

#### Step 1: Install `pacman` Packages

Run the following command to install the required system packages:

```sh
sudo pacman -S pipewire playerctl dart-sass networkmanager wl-clipboard brightnessctl python pacman-contrib gtk3 cairo gtk-layer-shell libgirepository gobject-introspection gobject-introspection-runtime python-pip python-gobject python-psutil python-cairo python-loguru pkgconf wf-recorder kitty grimblast gnome-bluetooth
```

#### Step 2: Install AUR Packages with `yay`

Use `yay` to install the required AUR packages:

```sh
    yay -S gray-git python-fabric rlottie
```

#### Step 3: Run the `init.sh -start` Script

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the bar or environment:

```sh
./init.sh -start
```

## **Usage**

### **For Hyprland:**

Add this to your `.config/hyprland.conf`

```sh
exec = `$HOME/bar/init.sh -start`

```

> **Note**: modify the path accordingly

### **For Other Window Managers:**

Use a similar configuration for your respective window manager's autostart setup.

## Updating

Updating to latest commit is fairly simple, just git pull the latest changes.

> **Note**: make sure to keep the config safe just in case

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. **Cannot see system tray?**

Be sure to kill any bars that you may be running. You can kill other bar with `pkill bar-name`

### 2. **Cannot see bar? **

Kill the app with `pkill hydepanel`. Cd to the folder , activate venv with `source .venv/bin/activate` and run `python main.py`.
This should show some logs. If it shows like `ModuleNotFoundError`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
If this does not solve the issue, do report a bug.
