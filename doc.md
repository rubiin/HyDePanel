# System Configuration

This repository defines the configuration settings for a modular system, allowing users to customize the layout, icons, intervals, and various components. The configuration is written in Python and structured using typed dictionaries for strong typing.

## Default Configuration

The default configuration is stored in the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` dictionary. It includes default values for various sections, such as the layout of the bar, settings for battery, CPU, weather, and other system components.
By default, `config.json` is read. If the config is not found, then `config.toml` is read. For sample configuration, please see `example` folder.

# General Configuration

```json
    "general": {
        "screen_corners": {
            "enabled": false,
            "size": 20,
        },
        "desktop_clock": {
            "enabled": false,
            "anchor": "center",
            "date_format": "%A, %d %B %Y",
        },
        "check_updates": false,

## Layout Configuration

The layout configuration defines the sections of the bar and the components displayed in each section:

```json
"layout": {
    "left_section": ["workspaces", "window_title"],
    "middle_section": ["date_time"],
    "right_section": [
        "weather",
        "updates",
        "battery",
        "bluetooth",
        "system_tray",
        "power",
    ],
}
```
